    "The input material you will use is a file named `CovidLockdownCatalonia.json.gz` available in the [data/](data/) directory. This is a gzip-compressed file, which you can de-compress using the `gunzip` command. The file contain about 35,500 messages (\"tweets\") posted between March 13th, 2020, and March 14th, 2020, containing a hashtag or keyword related to COVID-19, and posted by a user declaring a location in Catalonia.\n",

This is a website that provides COVID-19 collections of tweets, however, they only provide the identifier of the tweet, known as a tweet-id. To recover the entire tweet, a process commonly known as *re-hydration* was used, which involves querying an API from Twitter, giving the tweet-id, and obtaining the tweet. This can be done with a little bit of programming or using a software such as [twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc#dehydrate).\n",
