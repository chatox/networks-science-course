To recover the entire tweet, a process commonly known as *re-hydration* was used, which involves querying an API from Twitter, giving the tweet-id, and obtaining the tweet. This can be done with a little bit of programming or using a software such as [twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc#dehydrate).\n",
