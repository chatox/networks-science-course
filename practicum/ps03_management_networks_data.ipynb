    "\n",
    "If you want to split a string into pieces, you can use the following. Suppose the variables `genes` contains a comma-separated list such as `CYP17A1, CYP17, P450C17`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "gene_list = genes.split(\",\")\n",
    "for gene in gene_list:\n",
    "    gene = gene.strip()\n",
    "    ...\n",

    "\n",
    "The `str.strip()` method removes white space and newlines from the beginning and end of the string, so it's equivalent to `str.lstrip().rstrip()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also do this in one line of code, using the `map(f, v)` function, which results the result of applying function `f` to each element of list `v`:\n",

    "```python\n",

    "## 0.2. Producing the intersection and union of lists\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways of intersecting two lists in Python, one of the simplest ones is to convert them to sets, and then computing the set intersection using the built-in `&` operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def intersection(list1, list2):\n",
    "    return(list(set(list1) & set(list2)))\n",
