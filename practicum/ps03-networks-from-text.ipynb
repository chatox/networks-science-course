The file contains around 35,500 messages (\"tweets\") posted between March 13th, 2020, and March 14th, 2020, containing a hashtag or keyword related to COVID-19, and posted by a user declaring a location in Catalonia.\n",

This is a website that provides COVID-19 collections of tweets, however, they only provide the identifier of the tweet, known as a tweet-id. To recover the entire tweet, a process commonly known as *re-hydration* was used, which involves querying an API from Twitter, giving the tweet-id, and obtaining the tweet. This can be done with a little bit of programming or using a software such as [twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc#dehydrate).\n",

On the other end of the spectrum, software packages like [graph-tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/), [igraph](https://igraph.org/), and [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/#download) provide efficient algorithms for analysis and visualization of large networks, but may be less intuitive and take more time to learn and get used to. [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) has become popular partly because it sits somewhere in the middle: with easy installation, fairly intuitive API, and decent flexibility. You might not need it for the most basic analysis, and if you have very large networks it might be too slow, but for a vast range of applications it's a versatile, powerful tool for network analysis, and thus you will find it useful as a data science tool going forward.\n",

    "\n",
    "With the `networkx` [drawing](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/drawing.html) utilities, we can plot networks (as `matplotlib` Figures) and customize node and edge styles any way we like.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw with Cytoscape, the two basic elements of a network visualization are the **layout** and the element (node, edge) **styles**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic visualization function in `networkx` is [`nx.draw()`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.drawing.nx_pylab.draw.html), which has the following signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    nx.draw(g, pos=node_layout, **style_keywords)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Very briefly:\n",
    "* We specify the graph we want to draw as `g`.\n",
    "* The `pos` parameter takes as argument a dictionary mapping nodes in `g` to positions (coordinates in 2D space). \n",
    "    * There are [many functions](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/drawing.html#module-networkx.drawing.layout) in `networkx` for generating different layouts (i.e. node positions). Below we give an example using [`nx.spring_layout()`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.drawing.layout.spring_layout.html).\n",
    "* In `style_keywords` we pass the function a set of keyword arguments (either as a dictionary, or one-by-one) that affect the appearance of nodes, edges, and labels. \n",
    "    * For the basic set of parameters we can pass, and their formats, see the documentation entry of [`nx.draw_networkx()`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.drawing.nx_pylab.draw_networkx.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are basically two approaches for plotting with `networkx`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using the basic `nx.draw()` function, and passing the styles as arguments to that function; or\n",
    "* Using separate calls to `draw_networkx_nodes()`, `draw_networkx_edges()` and `draw_networkx_labels()` to draw the respective elements separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The former approch is simpler, and is recommended at the beginning. The latter approach allows for a few more customizations and is more useful when dealing with large networks where the drawing may take a long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that under the hood `nx.draw()` uses the `draw_networkx_nodes()`, etc., functions, and it is those lower-level functions that define the names and permitted values of the styling parameters. You should check their documentation for reference.\n",
